## Work Description
1. Used Leaflet and the US Geological Services Earthquake API to create a map of all Earthquakes that have happened in the past month
2. Using Leaflet, created the following:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marker clusters of the locations of each earthquake including a popup that shows the location of the earthquake, the magnitude, and the depth \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A heatmap showing the density of earthquakes \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Circle markers for each earthquake where the color is based on the depth of the earthquake and where the radius is based on the magnitude of the earthquake \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A legend for the depth of the earthquakes
3. Used geoJSON of the tectonic plates to add the tectonic plates to the map to see which earthquakes were likely due to movement of the tectonic plates
